<h1 id="applicationhowtos">Application Howto&#8217;s</h1>

<p>There is a lot of things provided in the &#8220;app&#8221; here so I will attempt to explain them all for reference. Mostly as a list of how to&#8217;s for things such as adding new views or data models. </p>

<h2 id="initialsetup">Initial Setup</h2>

<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll probably have to do is the initial setup. This involves mostly file naming and a few edits within files or removal of things you don&#8217;t want. </p>

<h3 id="createanewgitignorefile">Create a new &#8220;gitignore&#8221; file</h3>

<p>Ignore:
- .gitignore
- <em>.codekit
- </em>.conf
- .DS_Store</p>

<h3 id="files">Files</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>/app folder: The root app folder. You&#8217;ll want to add/remove from the helpers, controllers and views folders as meets the needs for your app. </p></li>
<li><p>[your_app_name].coffee: This should define your custom App. I typically also define a Query object and custom base Controller though these could be in separate files if you want. </p></li>
<li><p>app.coffee: Append your custom app file here and pass it into the App.init</p></li>
<li><p>declaration.coffee: Create your base object in here. This is kinda lame, but due to how Codekit does file append/prepend it ensures this object exists at the beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>/app/conf: Update the settings in these files to reflect your app</p></li>
<li><p>/app/public/includes: There are some basic resources available you can include from here</p></li>
</ul>
