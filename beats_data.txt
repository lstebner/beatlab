data file for beats
everything is considered data after the line `---` and before that can be comments

# comments can also be anywhere starting with a pound like this line

the very first line is the data keys in order and each line after that is a beat

# example
# the very first index here is actually a "key" which can be used later to
# re-reference the same beat. 
$boombastic1, 01 boombastic beat 1.wav, Boom beat 1, ...
$boombastic2, 02 boombastic beat 2.wav, Boom beat 2, ...

since most beats are collections, a simple way to define collections has been created.

the line starting with `collection` means you are defining a collection block, it can
be given a dir that all files will be located in and you can exclude the collection name
when giving data for each. 

collections cannot be defined within collections.

collections can be bulk hidden by passing `hide: true` to the collection block

collection: Boombastic Hits, dir: boombastic_hits
  $boombastic1
  $boombastic2
